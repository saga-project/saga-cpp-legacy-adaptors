                   - OMII GridSAM Adaptor Installation -


  (1) The GridSAM adaptor requires OpenSSL which should be available on any
      system. If your OpenSSL is not installed in the default system paths
      or if you want to use a specific version, use the following configure
      option:

        ./configure --with-openssl=DIR

  (2) Calling ./configure checks for the availability of the OpenSSL libs and 
      returns 'yes' if the GridSAM adaptor can be build:

        configure: ========================================================   
        configure: SAGA OMII ADAPTORS - Configured Adaptors                   
        configure: ========================================================   
        configure: 
        configure: Job (GridSAM)         : yes                 
        configure: 

  (3) Now, type 'make' and 'make install' to build the OMII GridSAM adaptor!
