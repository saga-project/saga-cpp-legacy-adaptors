:DESCRIPTION:

 The AWS job adaptor manages jobs on virtual machine instances on Cloud backends
 which use the Amazon web service interface (AWS).  These VM instances are
 created on the fly, if they do not yet exist.


:CHANGELOG:

  - initial version, can handle EC2, Eucalyptus, and Nimbus


:REQUIRES:

  All AWS adaptors require the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) and the AWS
  command line tools.  Java needs to be provided by the system.  The AWS command
  line tools are actually included under external/ - but costom versions can be
  used by specifying their location to configure.   


:CONFIGURE OPTIONS:

  | --with-java=DIR   use java (default is YES) at DIR (optional) |\\
  | --with-aws=DIR    use aws (default is YES) at DIR (optional)  |\\
  |                                                               |\\
  | AWS_LOCATION      AWS  installation root (default: EC2_HOME)  |\\
  | JAVA_LOCATION     JAVA installation root (default: JAVA_HOME) |\\
  

:INI OPTIONS:

  At the moment, SAGA does not allow to (easily) share ini options between
  adaptors.  Thus, all AWS ini options are actually replicated between all ini
  adaptors - this will be fixed at some point.  Up to then, however, the ini
  documentation of the aws context adaptor will cover the ini settings for *all*
  aws adaotors - please see there for deails.
