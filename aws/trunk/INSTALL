  AWS Backend
  -----------

    In order to use the aws adaptor suite, you will obviously need an AWS
    backend.  That is any cloud provider which can be used via the AWS Command
    Line Tools (see below).  This adaptor was tested against EC2, Nimbus and
    Eucalyptus.


  AWS Command Line Tools
  ----------------------

    The AWS adaptor depends on the Amazon command line tools ('Amazon EC2 API
    Tools'), which need to be installed on the system you want to use this
    adaptor on, i.e. on the system running your SAGA application.

    You find these tools when googling for 'Amazon EC2 API Tools', or  directly
    at http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/entry.jspa?externalID=351 

    It may be helpful to skim the tool documentation and prerequsites at
    http://docs.amazonwebservices.com/AWSEC2/2009-08-15/GettingStartedGuide/
    (for newer versions, please check
    http://developer.amazonwebservices.com/connect/kbcategory.jspa?categoryID=87).
    
    Note that these tools require a functional Java installation.  We recommend
    to install the tools into /usr/local/packages/aws .


  SSH Adaptor and Utilities
  -------------------------

    The AWS adaptor is heavily leaning on the ssh adaptor to interact with the
    instanciated virtual machines.  You must thus ensure that the ssh adaptor
    suite is installed, too.  For that you will need the ssh command line tool
    for job submission, and the fuse/sshfs tools for file access to your VM
    instance.

  
CONFIGURATION
-------------

  ./configure --help shows you (extract)

    --with-java=DIR         use java (default is YES) at DIR (optional)
    --with-aws=DIR          use aws  (default is YES) at DIR (optional)

    AWS_LOCATION            AWS installation root  (EC2_HOME)
    JAVA_LOCATION           JAVA installation root (JAVA_HOME)

  So, after installing Java and the AWS tools, either point the XXX_LOCATION
  variables to these installations, or specify them via the --with-xxx=path
  options.  Configure should mostly be able to pick up your java installation
  automatically, but you may need to specify the AWS installation path.
