                  <http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/software/python>


  For detailed informations on how to install SAGA, please refer 
  to the documentation section on our website:

    http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/software/cpp/documentation 


  PREREQUISISTES:
  
  o SAGA Core Components
    You have to install the SAGA Core Components before you can install the
    Python Bindings. The Core Components are available on the SAGA website.

  o SAGA X.509 Adaptor
    The Globus Adaptors require the SAGA X.509 adaptor to manage the
    certificates. It is available in the download section of the SAGA website.

  o Boost C++ Libraries >= 1.33
    You need to have the Boost C++ libraries installed on your system. Many
    systems already provide binary packages for them. If your system doesn't 
    you can download the source from http://www.boost.org and build it yourself.
    
  o Globus Toolkit >= 4.0
    You need to have at the client side libraries and headers for the 
    Globus Toolkit (GRAM, GridFTP, RLS) installed. They're available from
    the Globus website: http://www.globus.org/toolkit/.
    
 
  BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE GLOBUS ADAPTORS
 
  The Globus Adaptors come with a configure/make-based buildsystem. There are 
  some useful options for ./configure:

    --boost-location=       The location of your Boost installation
                            (e.g. /usr/local/packages/boost-1.42). You only
                            need this option if boost is *not* installed in
                            the default path (/usr/ or /usr/local
    --with-globus-location= The location of your Globus installation. This is
                            usually something like /usr/local/globus-XX or
                            /opt/globus-XX
    --with-globus-flavor=   The flavor of your Globus installation. Check the
                            inlcude directory of your Globus installation to
                            see which flavors are available. If you don't provide
                            the Globus flavor, configure will try to detect
                            it automatically. This works sometimes.

  For a complete list of configure options, you can typ

    ./configure --help
 

  To configure, build and install the Globus Adaptors, make sure that 
  $SAGA_LOCATION points to your SAGA Core Components installation and
  execute ./configure and make:

    $> export SAGA_LOCATION=/PATH/TO/SAGA_CORE_INSTALLATION
    $> ./configure --with-boost=/BOOST/DIR/ --globus-location=/GLOBUS/DIR
    $> make
    $> make install



  Please help us to improve the quality of SAGA and file a bug report if you 
  have encountered any problems with the build system. Our bug-tracking system
