                           - Release Changelog -

  
  
  Changes with SAGA Globus Adaptors Version 0.9.5           21. November 2010
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  o Fixed an error introduced with the race-condition fix in 0.9.4. In case of
    an early submit error (e.g. if a globus host wasn't configured probably) 
    the adaptor didn't terminate and hang forever because it still tried to
    wait for its monitoring thread to terminate although the monitoring thread
    was never started at all. 
  
  
  Changes with SAGA Globus Adaptors Version 0.9.4           05. November 2010
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o Fixed a race-condition in the submission process that prevent certain
    GRAM error messages to show up

  o Fixed several issues with the module loader. The daunting assertion
    globus_l_is_initialized==1 should be hopefully eradicated once and 
    for all.
 
  o Enabled library versioning (naming) for the Globus adaptors.


  Changes with SAGA Globus Adaptors Version 0.9.3          28. September 2010
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  o Fixed another Boost filesystem API incompatibility that prevented the
    GridFTP adaptor from building on Boost =< 1.34.
    

  Changes with SAGA Globus Adaptors Version 0.9.2          26. September 2010
  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
  o Fixed GRAM adaptor runtime issue (threading error) with Globus >= 5.0.2
  o GridFTP preserves executable file attributes during remote copy now
  o Fixed GridFTP bug that didn't allow to copy a file url into a directory
    without explicitly the target filename. 
  o GridFTP allows FTP protocol logging for debugging purposes now. This can
    be enable in the adaptor.ini file by setting "write_ftp_log = true".
