               - Globus Toolkit preWS Adaptors Installation -


  (1) Make sure the you have the Globus Toolkit installed (no services need to 
      be configured) and your globus environment varaibles are set properly:
  
        $GLOBUS_LOCATION (something like /usr/local/globus...)
        $GLOBUS_FLAVOUR (something gcc32dbgpthr)

  (2) Calling ./configure checks for the availability of the Globus libs and 
      returns a list of adaptors that can be build:

        configure: ========================================================   
        configure: SAGA GLOBUS ADAPTORS - Configured Adaptors                 
        configure: ========================================================   
        configure: 
        configure: File (GridFTP)           : yes             
        configure: Job (preWS GRAM)         : yes              
        configure: Logical File (RLS)       : yes    

  (3) Now, type 'make' and 'make install' to build the Globus Toolkit adaptors!
