                             SAGA Globus Adaptors

The Globus adaptors implement the SAGA job API on top of Globus GRAM (2 and 5), 
the SAGA file API on top of Globus GridFTP and the SAGA replica API on top of 
Globus RLS (Replica Location Service).

For detailed informations on how to install SAGA, please refer 
to the documentation section on our website:

  ATTENTION:

    The Globus adaptors use versioning now, so please make sure that you
    DELETE the old Globus adaptors in your SAGA_LOCATION before you 
    install a newer version, otherwise you might experience weird side-
    effects! Do something like:
 
      rm -rf $SAGA_LOCATION/lib/libsaga_adaptors_globus*


  PREREQUISISTES:
  
  o SAGA Core Components
    You have to install the SAGA Core Components before you can install the
    Globus Adaptors. The Core Components are available on the SAGA website.

  o SAGA X.509 Adaptor
    The Globus Adaptors require the SAGA X.509 adaptor for certificate
    handling. It is available for download on the SAGA website.

  o Boost C++ Libraries >= 1.33
    You need to have the Boost C++ libraries installed on your system. Many
    systems already provide binary packages for them. If your system doesn't 
    you can download the source from http://www.boost.org and build it yourself.
    
  o Globus Toolkit >= 4.0
    You need to have at the client side libraries and headers for the 
    Globus Toolkit (GRAM, GridFTP, RLS) installed. They're available from
    the Globus website: http://www.globus.org/toolkit/.
    
 
  BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE GLOBUS ADAPTORS
 
  The Globus Adaptors come with a configure/make-based buildsystem. There are 
  some useful options for ./configure:

    --boost-location=       The location of your Boost installation
                            (e.g. /usr/local/packages/boost-1.42). You only
                            need this option if boost is *not* installed in
                            the default path (/usr/ or /usr/local
    --with-globus-location= The location of your Globus installation. This is
                            usually something like /usr/local/globus-XX or
                            /opt/globus-XX
    --with-globus-flavor=   The flavor of your Globus installation. Check the
                            inlcude directory of your Globus installation to
                            see which flavors are available. If you don't 
                            provide the Globus flavor, configure will try to 
                            detect it automatically. This works sometimes.

  For a complete list of configure options, you can typ

    ./configure --help
 

  To configure, build and install the Globus Adaptors, make sure that 
  $SAGA_LOCATION points to your SAGA Core Components installation and
  execute ./configure and make:

    $> export SAGA_LOCATION=/PATH/TO/SAGA_CORE_INSTALLATION
    $> ./configure --with-boost=/BOOST/DIR/ --globus-location=/GLOBUS/DIR
    $> make
    $> make install


  KNOWN PROBLEMS

  If compilation fails with the following error message:

    liblinking   libsaga_adaptor_globus_module_loader_util.so
    ld: skipping incompatible libsaga_core.so when searching for -lsaga_core
    ld: skipping incompatible libsaga_core.a when searching for -lsaga_core
    ld: cannot find -lsaga_core

  Your SAGA Core installation and your globus installation have been compiled
  for different architecture (32-bit/64-bit) and it is not possible to link
  32-bit and 64-bit libraries together. You either have to re-build Globus 
  Toolkit or SAGA Core. In many cluster environments, different 'flavors' of 
  Globus are installed - in that case you can try to pick a flavor with 
  has the same architecture like your SAGA installation:
 
    ./configure --with-globus-flavor=gcc64dbgpthr (or gcc32dbgpthr)
 

  On Debian based Linux systems, the 'make deb' target requires the
  grid-packaging-tools package to be installed, additionally to the
  globus devel packages.


  Please help us to improve the quality of SAGA and file a bug report if you 
  have encountered any problems with the build system. Our bug-tracking system
