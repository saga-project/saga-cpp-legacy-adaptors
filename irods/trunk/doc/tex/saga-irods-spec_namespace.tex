                     int           mode = None)
Inputs:   s:     session handle
          url:   initial working dir
          mode:  open mode
InOuts:   N/A

PreCond:  N/A
PostCond: - the entry is opened.
          - 'Owner' of target is the id of the context
            use to perform the opereration, if the
            entry gets created.
Perms:    Exec for parent directory.
          Write for parent directory if Create is set.
          Write for url if Write is set.

Notes:    - the default mode is 'None' (0)
          - the constructor performs an open of the

Notes:    - if the target is a directory, the source entry

Purpose:  closes the object

Inputs:   timeout: seconds to wait
InOuts:   N/A
Outputs:  N/A
PreCond:  N/A
PostCond: - the entry instance is closed.
Perms:    N/A
Throws:   NotImplemented

Notes:    - any subsequent method call on the object
            MUST raise an ÅfIncorrectStateÅf exception
            (apart from DESTRUCTOR and close()).
          - close() can be called multiple times, with no 
            side effects. 
          - if close() is implicitely called in the 
            DESTRUCTOR, it will never throw an exception.

Purpose:  CONSTRUCTOR; create the object

InOuts:   N/A
Outputs:  obj:   the newly created object

PostCond: - the directory is opened.
          - 'Owner' of target is the id of the context
            use to perform the opereration, if the

          AuthorizationFailed
          AuthenticationFailed

          NoSuccess
Notes:    - the semantics of the inherited constructors 
            apply
          - the constructor performs an open of the 
            entry 
          - all notes to the respective open call apply.
          - the default flags are ÅfNoneÅf (0).

            invalid directory name, a ÅfBadParameterÅf 
            exception is thrown.
          - if ÅfdirÅf does not exist, a ÅfDoesNotExistÅf

- std::vector<saga::url> list (string name_pattern = ".",

Purpose:  list entries in this directory
Format:   std::vector<saga::url>

                               int flags = None);
Inputs:   flags:        flags defining the operation modus

InOuts:   N/A
Outputs:  names:  array of names matching the name_pattern
PreCond:  N/A
PostCond: N/A
Perms:    Query for entries specified by name_pattern.

          AuthorizationFailed
          AuthenticationFailed
          Timeout
          NoSuccess
Notes:    - if name_pattern is not given (i.e. is an empty 
            string), all entries in the current working 
            directory are listed. 
          - if name_pattern is given and points to a 
            directory, the contents of that directory 
            are listed. 
          - the name_pattern follows the standard POSIX 
            shell wildcard specification, as described
            above.
          - list does not follow symbolically linked 
            directories, unless the ÅfDereferenceÅf flag 
            is specified - otherwise list lists symbolic 
            link entries with a matching name.
          - if the ÅfDeReferenceÅf flag is set, list 
            returns the name of link targets, not of the 
            link entry itself.
          - the default flags are ÅfNoneÅf (0). 
          - other flags are not allowed, and cause a 
            ÅfBadParameterÅf exception.
          - if the name_pattern cannot be parsed, a 
            ÅfBadParameterÅf exception with a descriptive 
            error message is thrown.
          - if the name_pattern does not match any entry, 
            an empty list is returned, but no exception is 
            raised.
          - similar to ÅflsÅf as defined by POSIX.

          Timeout

Notes:    - find operates recursively below the current 
            working directory if the ÅfRecursiveÅf flag is 
            specified (default)
          - find does not follow symbolically linked 
            directories, unless the ÅfDereferenceÅf flag 
            is specified - otherwise find lists symbolic 
            link entries with a matching name.
          - the default flags are ÅfRecursiveÅf (1).
          - other flags are not allowed, and cause a 
            ÅfBadParameterÅf exception.
          - the name_pattern follows the standard POSIX 
            shell wildcard specification, as described above.
          - the matching entries returned are path names 
            relative to cwd.
          - similar to ÅffindÅf as defined by POSIX, but 
            limited to the -name option.

          - note that no exception is thrown if the entry

Purpose:  gives the name of an entry in the directory
          based upon the enumeration defined by
          get_num_entries
Format:   const saga::url get_entry (unsigned int entry);
Inputs:   entry: index of entry to get
InOuts:   N/A
Outputs:  name:  name of entry at index
PreCond:  N/A
PostCond: N/A
Perms:    Query for cwd.

          Timeout 
          NoSuccess
Notes:    - Åf0Åf is the first entry
          - there is no sort order implied by the 
            enumeration, however an underlying 
            implementation MAY choose to sort the entries
          - subsequent calls to get_entry and/or 
            get_num_entries may return inconsistent data,
            i.e. no locking or state tracking is implied. 
            In particular, an index may be invalid - a 
            ÅfDoesNotExistÅf exception is then thrown (not a 
            ÅfBadParameterÅf exception).
          - vaguely similar to ÅfopendirÅf/ÅfreaddirÅf (2) as
