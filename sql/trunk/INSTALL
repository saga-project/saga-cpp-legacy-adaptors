    http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/documentation 


  PREREQUISISTES:
  
  o SAGA Core 
    You have to install the SAGA Core Components before you can install the
    Globus Adaptors. The Core Components are available on the SAGA website.

  o Boost C++ Libraries >= 1.33 You need to have the Boost C++ libraries
    installed on your system. Many systems already provide binary packages for
    them. If your system doesn't you can download the source from
    http://www.boost.org and build it yourself.
    
  o PostgreSQL >= <TODO>
    Description
    
    
  INSTALLING THE POSTGRESQL DATABASE
  
  Explain why we need a database. Explain how to install it using the
  SQL script.

 
  BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE ADAPTOR
 
  The adaptor comes with a configure/make-based buildsystem. There are 
  some useful options for ./configure:

    --boost-location=       The location of your Boost installation
                            (e.g. /usr/local/packages/boost-1.42). You only
                            need this option if boost is *not* installed in
                            the default path (/usr/ or /usr/local
    --with-xxx
    
    --with-yyy

  For a complete list of configure options, you can typ

    ./configure --help
 

  To configure, build and install the adaptor, make sure that $SAGA_LOCATION
  points to your SAGA Core installation and execute ./configure and make:

    $> export SAGA_LOCATION=/PATH/TO/SAGA_CORE_INSTALLATION
    $> ./configure 
    $> make
    $> make install



  Please help us to improve the quality of SAGA and file a bug report if you 
  have encountered any problems with the build system. Our bug-tracking system
