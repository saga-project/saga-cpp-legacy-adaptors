<h3>NAME</h3>
<code>grpc_signal_handler_set_np</code> - Set the signal handler.
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<code>
  grpc_error_t grpc_signal_handler_set_np(int sig_num, void (*sig_handler)(int))

</code>
<h3>ARGUMENTS</h3>
<dl>
<dt><code>  int sig_num</code></dt>
<dd>    The signal whose handler is modified.</dd>
<dt><code>  void (*sig_handler)(int))</code></dt>
<dd>    The address of a signal handler.</dd>
</dl>

<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>

<p>The grpc_signal_handler_set_np() function modifies signal dispositions
for Ninf-G Client.</p>

<p>Procedures for signal handling differs according to environments and a
signal to be processed.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>pthread flavors of GT 4.0.0 or later</strong>
    <p>Ninf-G uses signal handling API provided by GT4, but the API does
    not support SIGKILL, SIGSEGV, SIGABRT, SIGBUS, SIGFPE, SIGILL,
    SIGIOT, SIGPIPE, SIGEMT, SIGSYS, SIGTRAP, SIGSTOP, SIGCONT and
    SIGWAITING.</p>

    <p>If sig_num is supported by GT's signal handling API, sig_handler is
    called by a signal handling thread.</p>

    <p>if sig_num is not supported by GT's signal handling API,
    sig_handler is called as a signal handler registered by sigaction().</p>

<li><strong>pthread flavors of earlier than GT 4.0.0</strong>
    <p>Ninf-G has signal handling thread which supports the same signals
    as GT4 signal handling API.</p>

    <p>If sig_num is supported by a Ninf-G signal handling thread,
    sig_handler is called by the signal handling thread.
    Otherwise, sig_handler is called as a signal handler
    registered by sigaction().</p>

    <p>Note:  For pthread flavor on MacOS X, Ninf-G Client processes
    SIGSTP as well.</p>

<li><strong>nonthread flavors for all versions of GT.</strong>
    <p>sig_handler is called as a signal handler registered by
    sigaction().</p>
</ul>

<p>It is unsafe to call some system calls from the signal handler
registered by sigaction().  A list of safe system calls is available
on the following web page and IEEE Std 1003.1(POSIX).</p>

<p>This function is a new function in Ninf-G version 4.0.0.</p>

<p>This function is MT-safe.</p>

<h3>RETURN VALUE</h3>
<p>If successful, GRPC_NO_ERROR is returned. In the case of an error,
Error code is returned.</p>
<h3>ERRORS</h3>
<dl>
<dt><code>   GRPC_NOT_INITIALIZED</code></dt>
<dd>    GRPC client is not initialized yet.</dd>
<dt><code>   GRPC_OTHER_ERROR_CODE</code></dt>
<dd>    Internal error detected. </dd>
