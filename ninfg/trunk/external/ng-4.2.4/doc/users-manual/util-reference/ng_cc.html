<h3>NAME</h3>
<code>ng_cc</code> - The Ninf-G Client compiler
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<code>
  ng_cc [compiler options]

</code>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
  The ng_cc is a script that wraps the compiler and linker. It generates Ninf-G Client programs by compiling and linking application programs.<br>
<br>
  Options and arguments for the compiler and linker can be written on the ng_cc command line. Those are passed to the compiler and linker used in ng_cc .<br>
  For example, executing the following command will to generate Ninf-G Client(test_client) from the test_client.c application program using the default (C language) compiler and linker.<br>
<br>
<pre>
    % ng_cc -g -o test_client test_client.c
</pre>
<br>
  The default compiler and linker used by ng_cc is the C compiler and linker, cc. If the application program is written in C and the cc compiler and linker is used, executing the ng_cc command will create an Ninf-G Client.<br>
<br>
  A compiler and linker other than cc can be used by setting the  NG_COMPILER and NG_LINKER environment variables to specify the compiler and linker to be used by ng_cc.<br>
<br>

<p>Note: Mixed utilization of off_t and other file size related data
types may cause mismatch of data size.
By default, ng_cc uses large file option such as
_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 (on Linux) as its compile option.
Thus, the size of off_t type compiled by ng_cc may differ from the
size of off_t type compiled by non ng_cc command.</p>

<h3>ERRORS</h3>
<p>If the compiling of the application program fails,
the compiler error message is output.</p>
