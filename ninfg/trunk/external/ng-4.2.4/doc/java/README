This package includes a set of Java client APIs for Ninf-G system
allowing users to access remote libraries on Ninf-G servers via their
Java program.  We have built the package with pure Java so that 
you even access to Ninf-G servers from Windows machines. 

Ninf-G is a GridRPC system which offers network-based
numerical library functionality via the use of RPC technology.  Parts
of applications making procedure calls can be replaced with
high-performance, remote equivalents in a substantially transparent
manner, usually only a small modification to the call itself, without
any RPC data types, prologue/epilogues, IDL management, etc.

We have used a variety of off-the-shelf technologies including Java CoG 
Kit for accessing Globus services and Jakarta Ant for source code 
management. 

Requirement:
  - Java(JRE): 1.4 or later
    (http://java.sun.com/)

  - GT       : 4.0.0 or later(Java WS Core)
    (http://www.globus.org/)

  - Ant      : 1.5 or later
    (http://ant.apache.org/, It's called "Jakarta Ant" until version 1.5.)

We tested Ninf-G Java Client API on the following environments.
  - Fedora Core3(i386)
  - Globus Toolkit 4.0.1
  - J2SDK 1.4.2_08
  - Ant 1.6.2
