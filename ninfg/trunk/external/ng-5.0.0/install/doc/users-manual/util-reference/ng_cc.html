<h3>NAME</h3>
<code>ng_cc</code> - The Ninf-G Client compiler
<h3>SYNOPSIS</h3>
<code>
  ng_cc [compiler options]

</code>
<h3>DESCRIPTION</h3>
<p>The ng_cc is a script that wraps the compiler and linker.
It generates Ninf-G Client programs by compiling and linking
application programs.</p>

<p>Options and arguments for the compiler and linker can be
written on the ng_cc command line.
Those are passed to the compiler and linker used in ng_cc.
For example, executing the following command will to generate
Ninf-G Client(test_client) from the test_client.c
application program using the default (C language) compiler and
linker.</p>

<pre>
% ng_cc -g -o test_client test_client.c
</pre>

<p>The default compiler and linker used by ng_cc is the
C compiler and linker, cc.
If the application program is written in C and the cc compiler
and linker is used, executing the ng_cc command will create
an Ninf-G Client.</p>

<p>A compiler and linker other than cc can be used by setting
the NG_COMPILER and NG_LINKER environment variables to specify
the compiler and linker to be used by ng_cc.</p>

<p>Note: Mixed utilization of off_t and other file size related data
types may cause mismatch of data size.
By default, ng_cc uses large file option such as
_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 (on Linux) as its compile option.
Thus, the size of off_t type compiled by ng_cc may differ from the
size of off_t type compiled by non ng_cc command.</p>

<h3>ERRORS</h3>
<p>If the compiling of the application program fails,
the compiler error message is output.</p>
