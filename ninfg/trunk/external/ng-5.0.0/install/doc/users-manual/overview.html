<h3><a name="GridRPC">1.1 GridRPC</a></h3>

<p>Ninf-G is a reference implementation of the GridRPC API.  Ninf-G
makes remote procedure calls via various protocols and middleware
such as SSH and the Globus Toolkit.</p>

<p>GridRPC is middleware that provides a model for access to
remote libraries and parallel programming for tasks on a grid.
Typical GridRPC middleware includes Ninf and Netsolve.
The other GridRPC middleware includes GridSolve, DIET, and OmniRPC.</p>

<p>GridRPC is considered effective for use in the following
cases.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Commercial programs or libraries that use resources which are run
on particular computers on the grid are sometimes provided only
in binary format and cannot be executed on particular computers.
There are also problems concerning licensing and
source code compatibility.
Furthermore, when using resources that can only be used with
particular machines, such as video cameras, electron microscopes,
telescopes and sensors, processing for the use of those resources
on those machines is necessary.</p>

<p>In such cases, an environment that allows the resources
(including software) to be used on a particular computer is needed.</p>

<li>
<p>When there are many programs that execute routines that
do a large amount of computation on broadband servers on the grid,
it takes a lot of time just to run parts of the program.</p>

<p>The time required to run the program can be shortened by
off-loading such program parts to a broadband server.</p>

<p>In cases when there are strong demands on memory and disk space
on the client machine so that broadband computation cannot be done,
it is desirable to be able to do easily-understood offloading
with no consideration given to argument marshalling.</p>

<li>
<p>Execution of Parameter Sweep by multiple servers on the grid</p>

<p>Parameter Sweep is a program that enables execution of
computation on multiple servers
in parallel, using some subset of the parameters.
The respective servers run independently using different
parameters, with virtually no dependence on other servers.</p>

<p>There are surprisingly many programs like Parameter Sweep.</p>

<p>The Monte Carlo method program is one of them.</p>

<p>Although Parameter Sweep can also be implemented
with a Message Passing Interface (MPI),
programming is rather simple with GridRPC and
Parameter Sweep can be executed to match the (dynamically changing) scale
of the grid (execution by multiple clusters, taking resource
management, security, etc., into account).</p>

<li><p>Ordinary or large-scale task parallel programs on a grid</p>

<p>Task arrangement programs are easy to write with GridRPC.
An API that supports the synchronization of various
task arrangements with mixed exchange among multiple clients
and servers can be used.</p>

<p>GridRPC not only provides an interface for easy mathematical
computation and scheduling of tasks for parallel execution,
but the execution of processing that matches the (dynamically changing)
scale of the grid is possible, as in the case of Parameter Sweep.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="New_features_of_Ninf-G">
1.2 New features of Ninf-G Version 5</a></h3>

<p>New features and functions have been added
to Ninf-G Version 5 (Ninf-G5).</p>

<ul>
<li> External modules
<p>Ninf-G5 does not assume specific Grid middleware as prerequisites,
that is, unlike the past versions of Ninf-G (e.g. Ninf-G2, Ninf-G4),
Ninf-G5 works in non Globus Toolkit environments.</p>

<p>Major functions of Ninf-G5 include
(1) remote process invocation,
(2) communications between a client and servers, and
(3) information services and retrievals.
Realized by the following three external modules,
Ninf-G5 is able to implement these services according to
the available software environments.</p>

<ul>
<li> Invoke Server
<p>Invoke Server is a module to invoke remote processes according
to the available Grid middleware such as Globus Toolkit WS GRAM,
Pre-WS GRAM, Condor, and SSH.</p>

<p>Function/object handle management functions such as
grpc_function_handle_init() interacts with the Invoke Server to
control remote processes via function/object handles.</p>

<li> Communication Proxy
<p>Communication Proxy is a module to implement communications
between a Ninf-G Client and Ninf-G Executables.</p>

<p>In order to utilize specific communication libraries such as
Globus IO, Communication Proxy module for the communication
library is required.  Otherwise, Ninf-G uses native TCP/IP for
communications between a Ninf-G Client and Ninf-G Executables.</p>

<li> Information Service
<p>Information Service is a module to provide information about
Ninf-G Executables to the Ninf-G Client.</p>

<p>Information Service NRF (Ninf-G Remote Information File)
provides file based information services.</p>

</ul>

<li>Two types of communications between
a Ninf-G Client and Ninf-G Executables

<p>Ninf-G5 implements two types of communications between a Ninf-G
Client and Ninf-G Executables, one is connection-full and the
other one is connection-less.
The connection-full type keeps the connection until the Ninf-G
Executable will be disappeared.
The connection-less type disconnects the connection and the
connection will be established on demand such as by heartbeating
and transfer of arguments and results.
These two types are selectable by users according to the
characteristics of applications and runtime environments.</p>
</ul>

<h3><a name="Overview_of_Ninf-G">1.3 Overview of Ninf-G</a></h3>

<p>Ninf-G is a set of library functions that provide an RPC
capability in a Grid environment, based on the GridRPC API
specifications.</p>

<h4><a name="Clients_and_servers">1.3.1 Clients and servers</a></h4>

<p>Ninf-G and the application programs that use Ninf-G consist
of Ninf-G Executables that execute computation on
server machines, and Ninf-G Clients that issue requests
for computation to the Ninf-G Executables from client machines.</p>

<p>The Ninf-G Executables consist of functions that perform
calculations (calculation functions) and a Ninf-G stub program that
calls the calculation functions.
Communication between clients and servers is
accomplished by TCP/IP using a proprietary Ninf-G protocol.</p>

<p>The relationships between clients and servers are
illustrated in Fig. 1.</p>

<h4><a name="Program_hierarchy">1.3.2 Program hierarchy</a></h4>

<p>Ninf-G employs the capabilities provided by the Grid middleware 
(e.g. <a href="http://www.globus.org/">Globus Toolkit</a>)
for server machine authentication, 
information search, job start-up, communication on External Modules. 
The relationships between applications, Ninf-G, Grid middleware
and the OS are illustrated in Fig. 2.</p>

<h4><a name="Requirements_for_operation">
1.3.4 Requirements for operation</a></h4>

<p>Ninf-G allows the definition of a single computation function
(1) or multiple computation functions
(2) for a Ninf-G Executable running on a server machine.
The execution schemes for these are shown in Fig. 3.
In either case, it is possible to execute
just one computation function at a time on the Ninf-G Executable.
To execute multiple computation functions at the same time,
it is necessary to run multiple Ninf-G Executables. This is
illustrated in Fig. 4.</p>

<p>In Ninf-G, the second scheme (2) is referred to as
"Ninf-G Executable objectification" and the calling
of the computation is referred to as a "method call."</p>

<p>Ninf-G provides handles for manipulating a Ninf-G Executable.
Different handles are used for the two schemes, (1) and (2),
described above.
As shown in Table 3, two types of handles are provided,
function handles and object handles.</p>

<h4><a name="Starting_up_a_Ninf-G_Executable">
1.3.5 Starting up a Ninf-G Executable </a></h4>

<p>Ninf-G Executables that run on server machines are started
up from Ninf-G Clients, which run on client machines.
A Ninf-G Executable is started up by performing the following
procedure using the job control method provided by Invoke Server.</p>

<p>When running a Ninf-G Client program, however, there is no
particular need for the user to be aware of this mechanism.</p>

<ol>
<li>If the appropriate Invoke Server is not started on the Client,
the Invoke Server process is started first.
<li>Ninf-G Client sends request to the Invoke Server to start the job.
<li>The Invoke Server invokes the Ninf-G Executable on the remote
machine, by each Invoke Server individually.
</ol>

<p>For example, if the Invoke Server for Globus Toolkit WS-GRAM
is selected for use, the Invoke Server requests the remote WS-GRAM to
perform the invocation.
The requested remote WS-GRAM invokes the jobmanager,
and the jobmanager invokes the Ninf-G Executable.</p>

<p>This process is shown in Fig. 5.</p>

<h4> <a name="Registering_and_accessing_Ninf-G_Executable">
1.3.6 Registering and accessing Ninf-G Executable information </a></h4>

<p>Starting up a Ninf-G Executable requires
path information that specifies the location of
the Ninf-G Executable on that server machine.
Information on the functions that are called by
the Ninf-G Executable is also required.
That information is collectively referred to as
the Ninf-G Executable information.
Ninf-G provides the following methods of registering and
accessing Ninf-G Executable information.</p>

<p>When running a Ninf-G Client program, however, there is no
particular need for the user to be aware of this mechanism.</p>

<ul>
<li>A file that contains the Ninf-G Executable information
(a NRF file) is placed on the client machine.
The Ninf-G Client program obtains the Ninf-G Executable information
from this NRF file via Information Service NRF (Fig. 6). 

<center>
<img src="figure/overview-stubInformationNRF.png"
    alt="overview-stubInformationNRF.png">
<p>Figure 6: Get information from NRF file</p>
</center>

<li>The path information is defined in the configuration file
for the Ninf-G Client on the client machine.
The Ninf-G Client program obtains the path information
from the configuration file and uses it to start up
the Ninf-G Executable on the server machine.
The function information is obtained from
the Ninf-G Executable when it is started up (Fig. 7).

<h3><a name="Ninf-G_Design">
1.5 Ninf-G Design</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Design_function_handle">
1.5.1 Reducing Overhead for Initialization of Function Handles</a></h4>

<p>Ninf-G provides the following functionalities for reducing
overhead for initialization of function handles.</p>

<ul>
<li>Creating multiple function handles via a single 
Globus Toolkit GRAM call and providing an API for utilizing the functionality.

<p>A single Globus Toolkit GRAM call usually takes several seconds for GSI
authentication and a process invocation via the Globus Toolkit jobmanager.
This indicates that it will take more than several minutes to tens of
minutes for hundreds of GRAM calls on a large-scale cluster.  Also,
many jobmanager processes
which will be launched on the front-end node will increase the load on
the front-end node and cause the creation of additional overhead.</p>

<p>Ninf-G implements a functionality which enables the creation of multiple
function handles via a single GRAM call and provides an API for
utilizing this functionality.  For example, 
<code>grpc_function_handle_array_default_np()</code> takes three
arguments, a pointer to an array of function handles, the number of
function handles, and the name of the remote executable.  When 
<code>grpc_function_handle_array_default_np()</code> is invoked, Ninf-G will
construct an RSL in which the <code>count</code> attribute is specified as the
number of function handles, and pass the RSL to the GRAM.  This
allows invocation of multiple remote executables, i.e. initialization of
multiple function handles, via a single GRAM call.</p>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Design_data_transfer">
1.5.2 Making Data Transfers Efficient</a></h4>

<p>Ninf-G provides the following functionalities for efficient
data transfers and elimination of redundant data transfers.</p>

<ul>
<li>Implementation of a Ninf-G remote object

<p>Although the semantics of a remote executable is "stateless," it is
desirable to provide a "stateful" remote executable since typical
applications repeat computation for large data sets with different
parameters.
In the case of "stateless" executables, the executable needs to send the
data in every remote library call, which would be a severe problem in a
Grid environment.  Ninf-G provides a "stateful" remote executable as 
a "Ninf-G remote object."  A Ninf-G remote object can hold a "state" and
be used to eliminate redundant data transfers between a client and
servers.  Ninf-G provides API functions such as 
<code>grpc_object_handle_init_np()</code> and
<code>grpc_invoke_np()</code> for
utilizing Ninf-G remote objects.
<code>grpc_object_handle_init_np()</code> initializes a Ninf-G remote object
and creates an object handle which is represents a connection
between the client and the Ninf-G remote object.
<code> grpc_invoke_np()</code> calls methods of the Ninf-G remote object
as described in the Ninf-G IDL.
A Ninf-G remote object is an instance of a class which is defined in an
IDL file using <code>DefClass</code> statement on the server side.
Multiple methods, which can be invoked by a client using a client
API such as <code>grpc_invoke_np()</code>, can be defined in
a class using the <code>DefMethod</code> statement.
</p>

<li>Compression of transferred data

<p>Ninf-G enables data transfers with compression.  A flag which
specifies whether to enable or disable data compression, and a data size as
the threshold for compressing data can be specified in the client
configuration file.</p>

</ul>

<h4><a name="Design_unreliability">
1.5.3 Compensating for the Heterogeneity and Unreliability
of a Grid Environment</a></h4>

<p>In order to compensate for the heterogeneity and unreliability of a Grid
environment, Ninf-G provides the following functionalities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Client configuration formats for detailed description of server attributes

<p>The GridRPC API specifies that the first argument of a client program must
be a "client configuration file" in which information required for
running applications is described.
In order to compensate for the heterogeneity and unreliability
of a Grid environment, Ninf-G provides client configuration formats
for detailed description of server attributes
such as the Globus jobmanager, and a protocol for data transfers, etc.</p>

<li>Timeout value for initialization of a function handle and RPC

<p>If a server machine is fully utilized, requests for initialization of
function handles and remote library calls may be stuck in the queue
and will not be launched for a long time, and this may cause deadlock of
applications.  Ninf-G provides a functionality to specify a timeout
value for initialization of function handles as well as remote library
calls.  The timeout values can be specified in the client
configuration file.</p>

<li>Heartbeat

<p>A remote executable reports a heartbeat message to the client at a
pre-specified interval.  Ninf-G provides an API function for checking
the heartbeat from the remote executable.  The interval can be
specified in the client configuration file.</p>

<li>Client Callbacks

<p>Ninf-G provides a functionality called "client callbacks" by which
a remote executable calls a function on the client machine.  The client
callback can be used for sharing status between the server and the
client.  For example, the client callback can be used for showing the
interim status of computation at the client machine and in interactive
processing.</p>

<li>Cancellation of a session

<p>Ninf-G provides a server-side API function named
<code>grpc_is_canceled_np()</code> for checking the arrival of cancel requests
from the client.  If the client calls a <code>grpc_cancel()</code> function,
<code>grpc_is_canceled_np()</code> returns <code>1</code>.  In order to
implement cancellation of a session, remote executables are required
to call <code>grpc_is_canceled_np()</code> at an appropriate interval and
return by itself, if <code>grpc_is_canceled_np()</code> returns
<code>1</code>.</p>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Design_debug">
1.5.4 Supporting Debugging of Applications</a></h4>

<p>Ninf-G provides functionalities which are useful for debugging.
Ninf-G enables redirection of stdout and stderr of remote executables to
the client machine.  Log messages generated by Ninf-G can also be
stored on the client machine.  Furthermore, Ninf-G
enables the launch of "gdb" on the server machine when a remote executable
is launched on the server.  These functionalities are made available by
turning on the flags in the client configuration file.</p>

<h3> <a name="Compatibility_with_Ninf-G4">
1.6 Compatibility with Ninf-G4</a></h3>

<p>The GridRPC API and Ninf-G API implemented by Ninf-G5 is
compatible with Ninf-G4 except the following two items.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The acceptable format of the second argument (server_name) of
function/object handle initialize functions has been changed.
Ninf-G5 does not accept the format of Globus GRAM Resource
Manager Contact as a valid second argument though it can be
used in Ninf-G4.</p>

<li><p>An argument (error) has been added to comply with the
specification.
This change is a bug fix.</p>
</ul>

<p>The format of a Client configuration file is not compatible
between Ninf-G4 and Ninf-G5 though they are very similar.</p>

<p>Due to protocol changes, Ninf-G4 client cannot communicate with
Ninf-G5 executables and vice versa.</p>

<h3><a name="Assumed_environment_for_using_Ninf-G">
1.7 Assumed environment for using Ninf-G</a></h3>

<h4><a name="Prerequisites_for_installing_Ninf-G">
1.7.1 Prerequisites for installing Ninf-G</a></h4>

<ul>
<li><p>Globus Toolkit is not necessarily required. It is optional.</p>

<li><p>If the Globus Toolkit is used, the globus_core must be installed,
which is not installed by binary installer.

</ul>


<h4><a name="Environment_variables">
1.7.2 Environment variables for installing / using Ninf-G</a></h4>

<ul>
<li>NG_DIR must be set to the Ninf-G installation directory.

<li>Reading the user use environment setting file for use by Ninf-G,
read ${NG_DIR}/etc/ninfg-user-env.{sh,csh}.

<li>NG_LOG_LEVEL specifies the loglevel that controls the produced
error/warning messages during executions.
This variable is set to 2 (Error) by reading
${NG_DIR}/etc/ninfg-user-env.{sh,csh}.

<li>If the Globus Toolkit is used:
<ul>
<li>GLOBUS_LOCATION must be set to the Globus Toolkit installation 
directory. 

<li>Reading the user setting file for use by the Globus Toolkit, 
read ${GLOBUS_LOCATION}/etc/globus-user-env.{sh,csh}. 
</ul>
</ul>

<h4><a name="Execution_Environment">1.7.3 Execution Environment</a></h4>

<ul>
<li>If the Invoke Server GT4py (WS GRAM) or GT2c (Pre-WS GRAM) is used: 
<p>Ninf-G users must be capable of submitting jobs using the 
Globus Toolkit from a client machine on which Ninf-G Client 
programs will run to server machines on which the Globus gatekeeper 
is running and Ninf-G Executables will be launched by the 
Globus jobmanager.</p>
