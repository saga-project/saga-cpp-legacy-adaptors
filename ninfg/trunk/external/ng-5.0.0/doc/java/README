Ninf-G5 Java Client API

This package includes the following documents.
- README (This file)
- INSTALL
- FAQ
- BUG

This package includes a set of Java client APIs for Ninf-G system
allowing users to access remote libraries on Ninf-G servers via their
Java program.  We have built the package with pure Java so that 
you even access to Ninf-G servers from Windows machines. 

Ninf-G is a GridRPC system which offers network-based
numerical library functionality via the use of RPC technology.  Parts
of applications making procedure calls can be replaced with
high-performance, remote equivalents in a substantially transparent
manner, usually only a small modification to the call itself, without
any RPC data types, prologue/epilogues, IDL management, etc.

We have used a variety of off-the-shelf technologies Jakarta Ant for source
code management. 

Requirement:
  - Java(JRE): 5 or later
    (http://java.sun.com/)

  - Ant      : 1.6 or later
    (http://ant.apache.org/, It's called "Jakarta Ant" until version 1.5.)

We tested Ninf-G Java Client API on the following environments.
  - Ubuntu 7.10 (i386)
  - JDK 1.5.0_06
  - Ant 1.6.2
