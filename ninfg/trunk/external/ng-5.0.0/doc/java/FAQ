Ninf-G Java Client API FAQ

Q1, On Windows, Ninf-G client sometimes fails when it tries to handle
    simultaneous multiple requests.
A1, On Windows, ServerSocket sometimes fails to accept requests for connection
    from Ninf-G Executables when there are many (about 10 or more)
    simultaneous requests.
    This problem does not appears on Linux or Solaris.
    So Please use Linux or Solaris for large-scale client applications.

Q2, On Windows, Ninf-G Executables can't connect back to Ninf-G Client.
A2, Set "invoke_server_log" of <CLIENT> section in your client configuration
    file to "invoke.log", And check the argument string of
    "--connectbackAddress=ng_tcp://..." in "invoke.log.TYPE".
    There is a "--connectbackAddress=ng_tcp://..." in argument string, it
    indicates where to connect back from Ninf-G Executable. Wrong location may
    be specified. In order to avoid this, you can specify the location where to
    connect back in "hostname" attribute in <CLIENT> section of your
    client configuration file.  Following is an example of the description.

    ===== example of client configuration file =====
      <CLIENT>
        hostname 10.0.0.1
      </CLIENT>

Q3, Does Ninf-G Java Client library provide all functions which are
    supported by C client library?
A3, No.
    Following functions are not supported on Ninf-G Java Client library.
    + more than 31 arguments for NgGrpcFunctionHandle#call()
      and NgGrpcObjectHandle#invoke().
    + argument stack for NgGrpcFunctionHandle#call()
      and NgGrpcObjectHandle#invoke().
    + following attributes in configuration file will be ignored.
      - "save_sessionInfo" in "<CLIENT>" section
      - "refresh_credential" in "<CLIENT>" section
      - "argument_transfer" in "<SERVER>" section

Q4, Can null be specified as an argument of NgGrpcFunctionHandle#call() and
    NgGrpcObjectHandle#invoke()?
A4, Yes.  null can be specified as argument of NgGrpcFunctionHandle#call() and
    NgGrpcObjectHandle#invoke().
    But in this case, you have to specify the type of argument.
    When you specify null as an argument, please see
    src/java/diag/NullArgumentTest.java.

Q5, How can I use WS GRAM of GT4?
A5, If you want to use WS GRAM, you have to set <SERVER> "invoke_server"
    to "GT4py".  But "GT4py" does not work on Windows.  If you want to use
    WS GRAM on Windows, you have to use invoke_server "GT4java".
    See ng-5.x.x/src/InvokeServer/gt4java/README for more details.
