:DESCRIPTION:

  KFS is an adaptor for the distributed filesystem KFS also known as cloudstore.  Most features are there and you should be able to use this adaptor with little fear of complete failure.  You must download and build kfs to get the libraries installed.  Then point your makefile to the right locations and you should be good.  All you need is a working KFS deployment.  http://kosmosfs.sourceforge.net/ has all the information you need for that.
