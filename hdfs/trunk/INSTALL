                          <http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/>


  For detailed informations on how to install SAGA, please refer 
  to the documentation section on our website:

    http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/software/cpp/documentation 


  PREREQUISISTES:
  
  o SAGA Core Components
    You have to install the SAGA Core Components before you can install the
    Python Bindings. The Core Components are available on the SAGA website.

  o Boost C++ Libraries >= 1.33
    You need to have the Boost C++ libraries installed on your system. Many
    systems already provide binary packages for them. If your system doesn't 
    you can download the source from http://www.boost.org and build it yourself.
    
 
  BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE HDFS ADAPTOR
 
  The HDFS Adaptor comes with a configure/make-based buildsystem. 
  For a complete list of configure options, you can typ

    ./configure --help
 

  To configure, build and install the HDFS Adaptors, make sure that 
  $SAGA_LOCATION points to your SAGA Core Components installation and
  execute ./configure and make:

    $> export SAGA_LOCATION=/PATH/TO/SAGA_CORE_INSTALLATION
    $> ./configure --with-libhdfs-location
    $> make
    $> make install


  Please help us to improve the quality of SAGA and file a bug report if you 
  have encountered any problems with the build system. Our bug-tracking system
