:IMPLEMENTS PACKAGE:
 
  - saga_package_advert_service
  - saga_package_namespace

:DESCRIPTION:

  This is an implementation of Hbase for SAGA.  The functions work, but it isn't optimized at all to take advantage of row/column calls.  Needs thrift server running.
  
:URL SCHEMES:

  - hbase://

:REQUIRES:

  Also links against thrift libraries and includes thrift header files.  Also needs Hbase cpp files: Hbase.cpp Hbase_types.cpp Hbase_constants.cpp Look at Makefile to point to right locations

:CONFIGURE OPTIONS:

   | Nothing special

:INI OPTIONS:

  none


:KNOWN ISSUES:

  Not too efficient.  Doesn't take full advantage of Hbase
