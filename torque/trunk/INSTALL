           <http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/software/cpp/adaptors/torque/>
           

  For detailed informations on how to install SAGA, please refer 
  to the documentation section on our website:

    http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/software/cpp/documentation 


  PREREQUISISTES:
  
  o SAGA Core Components
    You have to install the SAGA Core Components before you can install the
    Python Bindings. The Core Components are available on the SAGA website.

  o Boost C++ Libraries >= 1.33
    You need to have the Boost C++ libraries installed on your system. Many
    systems already provide binary packages for them. If your system doesn't 
    you can download the source from http://www.boost.org and build it yourself.
    
 
  BUILDING AND INSTALLING THE TORQUE ADAPTOR
 
  The TORQUE Adaptor comes with a configure/make-based buildsystem. Currently,
  configure doesn't have any options.

  To configure, build and install the TORQUE Adaptors, make sure that 
  $SAGA_LOCATION points to your SAGA Core Components installation and
  execute ./configure and make:

    $> export SAGA_LOCATION=/PATH/TO/SAGA_CORE_INSTALLATION
    $> ./configure 
    $> make
    $> make install

  CONFIGURATION
  
  After you've installed the TORQUE Adaptor, you have to set the path
  to you TORQUE installation.
  
  You can either set the $TORQUE_HOME variable in your environment to
  the base directory of your local TORQUE installation or explicitly 
  put the path in the adaptor's configuration file:
  
  $SAGA_LOCATION/share/saga/saga_adaptor_torque_job.ini
  
  (change line that starts with: 'torque_location =')
  
  Please help us to improve the quality of SAGA and file a bug report if you 
  have encountered any problems with the build system. Our bug-tracking system 
  can be found at: http://saga.cct.lsu.edu/software/cpp/dev/
