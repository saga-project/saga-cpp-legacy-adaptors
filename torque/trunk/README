  For detailed informations on how to use SAGA in genereal, please refer 
  to the documentation section on our website:

  SPECIAL URL SCHEMES:

  The SAGA TORQUE adaptor supports two different URL schemes: torque:// for
  regular TORQUE systems and xt5torque:// for the TORQUE installations found
  on Cray T5 machines. The two schemes are not interchangeable. 

  To connect to a regular local TORQUE batch system, use the 
  following construct (example in Python):

    jd = saga.job.description()
    jd.executable = "/home/alone/mysim"
    jd.number_of_processes = 16
    jd.processes_per_host = 4

    js = saga.job.service("torque://localhost")
    mysim_job = js.create_job(jd)
    mysim_job.run()

  If you're on an XT5 machine, do the followng:

    jd = saga.job.description()
    jd.executable = "/home/alone/mysim"
    jd.number_of_processes = 16

    js = saga.job.service("xt5torque://localhost")
    mysim_job = js.create_job(jd)
    mysim_job.run()

  For mor information on TORQUE on XT5 systems, refer to you system's 
  documentation, e.g., http://bit.ly/dPjRME

  
  Please help us to improve the quality of SAGA and file a bug report if you 
  have encountered any problems with the build system. Our bug-tracking system
